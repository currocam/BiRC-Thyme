  abstract = {Motivation: ~De novo assemblies of genomes remain one of the most challenging applications in next-generation sequencing. Usually, their results are incomplete and fragmented into hundreds of contigs. Repeats in genomes and sequencing errors are the main reasons for these complications. With the rapidly growing number of sequenced genomes, it is now feasible to improve assemblies by guiding them with genomes from related species.Results: Here we introduce AlignGraph, an algorithm for extending and joining de novo-assembled contigs or scaffolds guided by closely related reference genomes. It aligns paired-end (PE) reads and preassembled contigs or scaffolds to a close reference. From the obtained alignments, it builds a novel data structure, called the PE multipositional de Bruijn graph. The incorporated positional information from the alignments and PE reads allows us to extend the initial assemblies, while avoiding incorrect extensions and early terminations. In our performance tests, AlignGraph was able to substantially improve the contigs and scaffolds from several assemblers. For instance, 28.7\textendash 62.3\% of the contigs of Arabidopsis thaliana and human could be extended, resulting in improvements of common assembly metrics, such as an increase of the N50 of the extendable contigs by 89.9\textendash 94.5\% and 80.3\textendash 165.8\%, respectively. In another test, AlignGraph was able to improve the assembly of a published genome (Arabidopsis strain Landsberg) by increasing the N50 of its extendable scaffolds by 86.6\%. These results demonstrate AlignGraph's efficiency in improving genome assemblies by taking advantage of closely related references.Availability and implementation: The AlignGraph software can be downloaded for free from this site: https://github.com/baoe/AlignGraph.Contact: ~thomas.girke@ucr.edu},

Fortunately, with more and more sequenced species available, it becomes possible to use the reference genome of a closely related species to detect misassemblies. In addition, long reads of the third generation sequencing technology have been more and more widely used, and can also help detect misassemblies. RESULTS: Here, we introduce ReMILO, a reference assisted misassembly detection algorithm that uses both short reads and PacBio SMRT long reads. ReMILO aligns the initial short reads to both the contigs and reference genome, and then constructs a novel data structure called red-black multipositional de Bruijn graph to detect misassemblies. In addition, ReMILO also aligns the contigs to long reads and find their differences from the long reads to detect more misassemblies. In our performance test on short read assemblies of human chromosome 14 data, ReMILO can detect 41.8-77.9\% extensive misassemblies and 33.6-54.5\% local misassemblies. On hybrid short and long read assemblies of S.pastorianus data, ReMILO can also detect 60.6-70.9\% extensive misassemblies and 28.6-54.0\% local misassemblies.

  abstract = {A central question in evolution is how several adaptive phenotypes are maintained within a species. Theory predicts that the genetic determination of a trait, and in particular the amounts of redundancy in the mapping of genotypes to phenotypes, mediates evolutionary outcomes of phenotypic selection. In Mediterranean wild thyme, numerous discrete chemical phenotypes (chemotypes) occur in close geographic proximity. Chemotypes are defined by the predominant monoterpene produced by individual plants in their essential oil. In this study, we analyze the ecological genetics of six chemotypes nested within two well-established chemical families (hereafter ecotypes). Ecotypes, and chemotypes within ecotypes, are spatially segregated, and their distributions track local differences in the abiotic environment. By combining population genomic, phenotypic, and environmental data from 700 individuals, we show how the genetics of ecotype determination mediates this evolutionary response. Variation in three terpene-synthase loci explains variation in ecotype identity, with one single locus accounting for as much as 78\% of this variation. Phenotypic selection combined with low segregating genotypic redundancy of ecotypes leaves a clear footprint at the genomic level: alleles associated with ecotype identity track environmental variation despite extensive gene flow. Different chemotypes within each ecotype differentially track environmental variation. Their identity is determined by multiple loci and displays a wider range of genotypic redundancy that dilutes phenotypic selection on their characteristic alleles. Our study thus provides a novel illustration of how genetic redundancy of a phenotype modulates the ability of selection to maintain adaptive differentiation. Identifying the precise genetics of the chemical polymorphism in thyme is the next crucial step for our understanding of the origin and maintenance of a polymorphism that is present in many aromatic plants.},

The method enables the use of not only within or closely-related species but also a more distantly-related species as a starting point to help to position reads using the longest common substring algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by experiments into two parts. First, shotgun sequences of a known species are simulated as new species to verify the performance of the algorithm, where the references are arbitrarily selected. Second, the effects of distances between the reference and the target sequences are studied. A known sequence with noise injection is represented as a reference for assembling its shotgun sequences. BLAST is used as a quality measurement between the resulting sequence and the ground truth. The experimental results showed that when reference sequences and target sequences are in the same genus, query cover and percent identity are 99.84\% and 99.89\% respectively; and when they are in the same order, query cover and percent identity are 85.21\% and 94.69\% respectively. The algorithm can stand the differences between the reference sequences and target sequences up to 20\% before the query cover and percent identity reduce to 95\%.},

However, existing algorithms either collapse heterozygous alleles into one consensus copy or fail to cleanly separate the haplotypes to produce high-quality phased assemblies. Here we describe hifiasm, a de novo assembler that takes advantage of long high-fidelity sequence reads to faithfully represent the haplotype information in a phased assembly graph. Unlike other graph-based assemblers that only aim to maintain the contiguity of one haplotype, hifiasm strives to preserve the contiguity of all haplotypes. This feature enables the development of a graph trio binning algorithm that greatly advances over standard trio binning. On three human and five nonhuman datasets, including California redwood with a \textasciitilde 30-Gb hexaploid genome, we show that hifiasm frequently delivers better assemblies than existing tools and consistently outperforms others on haplotype-resolved assembly.},

The arrival of next-generation sequencing technologies has allowed the rapid and efficient development of new genomic resources for non-model or orphan plant species. But the sequencing pace of plants is far from that of animals and microorganisms. This review focuses on the typical challenges of plant genomes that can explain why plant genomics is less developed than animal genomics. Explanations about the impact of some confounding factors emerging from the nature of plant genomes are given. As a result of these challenges and confounding factors, the correct assembly and annotation of plant genomes is hindered, genome drafts are produced, and advances in plant genomics are delayed.},

  abstract = {Contigs assembled from the third-generation sequencing long reads are usually more complete than the second-generation short reads. However, the current algorithms still have difficulty in assembling the long reads into the ideal complete and accurate genome, or the theoretical best result [1]. To improve the long read contigs and with more and more fully sequenced genomes available, it could still be possible to use the similar genome-assisted reassembly method [2], which was initially proposed for the short reads making use of a closely related genome (similar genome) to the sequencing genome (target genome). The method aligns the contigs and reads to the similar genome, and then extends and refines the aligned contigs with the aligned reads. Here, we introduce AlignGraph2, a similar genome-assisted reassembly pipeline for the PacBio long reads. The AlignGraph2 pipeline is the second version of AlignGraph algorithm proposed by us but completely redesigned, can be inputted with either error-prone or HiFi long reads, and contains four novel algorithms: similarity-aware alignment algorithm and alignment filtration algorithm for alignment of the long reads and preassembled contigs to the similar genome, and reassembly algorithm and weight-adjusted consensus algorithm for extension and refinement of the preassembled contigs. In our performance tests on both error-prone and HiFi long reads, AlignGraph2 can align 5.7\textendash 27.2\% more long reads and 7.3\textendash 56.0\% more bases than some current alignment algorithm and is more efficient or comparable to the others. For contigs assembled with various de novo algorithms and aligned to similar genomes (aligned contigs), AlignGraph2 can extend 8.7\textendash 94.7\% of them (extendable contigs), and obtain contigs of 7.0\textendash 249.6\% larger N50 value and 5.2\textendash 87.7\% smaller number of indels per 100 kbp (extended contigs). With genomes of decreased similarities, AlignGraph2 also has relatively stable performance.

  abstract = {One of the most difficult problems in modern genomics is the assembly of full-length chromosomes using next generation sequencing (NGS) data. To address this problem, we developed ``reference-assisted chromosome assembly'' (RACA), an algorithm to reliably order and orient sequence scaffolds generated by NGS and assemblers into longer chromosomal fragments using comparative genome information and paired-end reads. Evaluation of results using simulated and real genome assemblies indicates that our approach can substantially improve genomes generated by a wide variety of de novo assemblers if a good reference assembly of a closely related species and outgroup genomes are available. We used RACA to reconstruct 60 Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) chromosome fragments from 1,434 SOAPdenovo sequence scaffolds, of which 16 chromosome fragments were homologous to complete cattle chromosomes. Experimental validation by PCR showed that predictions made by RACA are highly accurate. Our results indicate that RACA will significantly facilitate the study of chromosome evolution and genome rearrangements for the large number of genomes being sequenced by NGS that do not have a genetic or physical map.},

It automatically chooses between local and end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is robust to sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range of sequence lengths from 70bp to a few megabases. For mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better performance than several state-of-art read aligners to date.

Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to process such data at scale, which presses for the development of new alignment algorithms. RESULTS: Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of {$\geq$}100\,bp in length, {$\geq$}1\,kb genomic reads at error rate {$\sim$}15\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3-4 times as fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is {$\geq$}30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of next-generation sequencing has made it possible to sequence whole genomes at a relatively low cost. However, de novo genome assemblies remain challenging due to short read length, missing data, repetitive regions, polymorphisms and sequencing errors. As more and more genomes are sequenced, reference-guided assembly approaches can be used to assist the assembly process. However, previous methods mostly focused on the assembly of other genotypes within the same species. We adapted and extended a reference-guided de novo assembly approach, which enables the usage of a related reference sequence to guide the genome assembly. In order to compare and evaluate de novo and our reference-guided de novo assembly approaches, we used a simulated data set of a repetitive and heterozygotic plant genome. RESULTS: The extended reference-guided de novo assembly approach almost always outperforms the corresponding de novo assembly program even when a reference of a different species is used. Similar improvements can be observed in high and low coverage situations. In addition, we show that a single evaluation metric, like the widely used N50 length, is not enough to properly rate assemblies as it not always points to the best assembly evaluated with other criteria. Therefore, we used the summed z-scores of 36 different statistics to evaluate the assemblies. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of reference mapping and de novo assembly provides a powerful tool to improve genome reconstruction by integrating information of a related genome. Our extension of the reference-guided de novo assembly approach enables the application of this strategy not only within but also between related species. Finally, the evaluation of genome assemblies is often not straight forward, as the truth is not known. Thus one should always use a combination of evaluation metrics, which not only try to assess the continuity but also the accuracy of an assembly.},

It is equally essential to guide subsequent or comparative analyses with existing data, as the correct interpretation of the results necessarily requires knowledge about the quality level and reliability of the inputs. Using datasets of near universal single-copy orthologs derived from OrthoDB, BUSCO can estimate the completeness and redundancy of genomic data by providing biologically meaningful metrics based on expected gene content. These can complement technical metrics such as contiguity measures (e.g., number of contigs/scaffolds, and N50 values). Here, we describe the use of the BUSCO tool suite to assess different data types that can range from genome assemblies of single isolates and assembled transcriptomes and annotated gene sets to metagenome-assembled genomes where the taxonomic origin of the species is unknown. BUSCO is the only tool capable of assessing all these types of sequences from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. The protocols detail the various BUSCO running modes and the novel workflows introduced in versions 4 and 5, including the batch analysis on multiple inputs, the auto-lineage workflow to run assessments without specifying a dataset, and a workflow for the evaluation of (large) eukaryotic genomes. The protocols further cover the BUSCO setup, guidelines to interpret the results, and BUSCO ``plugin'' workflows for performing common operations in genomics using BUSCO results, such as building phylogenomic trees and visualizing syntenies. \textcopyright{} 2021 The Authors.

Using a newly developed reference-guided approach, we assembled large contigs from 9 to 42 Gb of Illumina short-read data from the Landsberg erecta (Ler-1), C24, Bur-0, and Kro-0 strains, which have been sequenced as part of the 1,001 Genomes Project for this species. Using alignments against the reference sequence, we first reduced the complexity of the de novo assembly and later integrated reads without similarity to the reference sequence. As an example, half of the noncentromeric C24 genome was covered by scaffolds that are longer than 260 kb, with a maximum of 2.2 Mb. Moreover, over 96\% of the reference genome was covered by the reference-guided assembly, compared with only 87\% with a complete de novo assembly. Comparisons with 2 Mb of dideoxy sequence reveal that the per-base error rate of the reference-guided assemblies was below 1 in 10,000. Our assemblies provide a detailed, genomewide picture of large-scale differences between A. thaliana individuals, most of which are difficult to access with alignment-consensus methods only. We demonstrate their practical relevance in studying the expression differences of polymorphic genes and show how the analysis of sRNA sequencing data can lead to erroneous conclusions if aligned against the reference genome alone.

Chromosome level genome assemblies using sequence contigs generated from long read sequencing have involved the use of proximity analysis (Hi-C) or traditional genetic maps to guide the placement of sequence contigs within chromosomes. The development of highly accurate long reads by repeated sequencing of circularized DNA (HiFi; PacBio) has greatly increased the size of contigs. We now report the use of HiFiasm to assemble the genome of Macadamia jansenii, a genome that has been used as a model to test sequencing and assembly. This achieved almost complete chromosome level assembly from the sequence data alone without the need for higher level chromosome map information. Eight of the 14 chromosomes were represented by a single large contig (six with telomere repeats at both ends) and the other six assembled from two to four main contigs. The small number of chromosome breaks appears to be the result of highly repetitive regions including ribosomal genes that cannot be assembled by these approaches. De novo assembly of near complete chromosome level plant genomes now appears possible using these sequencing and assembly tools. Further targeted strategies might allow these remaining gaps to be closed.},

However, the absence of a fully sequenced thyme genome limits functional genomic studies of Chinese native thymes. Thymus quinquecostatus \v{C}elak., which contains large amounts of bioactive monoterpenes such as thymol and carvacrol, is an important wild medicinal and aromatic plant in China. Monoterpenoids are abundant in glandular secretory trichomes. Here, high-fidelity and chromatin conformation capture technologies were used to assemble and annotate the T.~quinquecostatus genome at the chromosome level. The 13 chromosomes of T.~quinquecostatus had a total length of 528.66 Mb, a contig N50 of 8.06 Mb, and a BUSCO score of 97.34\%. We found that T.~quinquecostatus had experienced two whole-genome duplications, with the most recent event occurring {$\sim$}4.34 million years ago. Deep analyses of the genome, in conjunction with comparative genomic, phylogenetic, transcriptomic, and metabonomic studies, uncovered many regulatory factors and genes related to monoterpenoids and glandular secretory trichome development. Genes encoding terpene synthase (TPS), cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs), short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR), R2R3-MYB, and homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) IV were among those present in the T.~quinquecostatus genome. Notably, Tq02G002290.1 (TqTPS1) was shown to encode the terpene synthase responsible for catalyzing production of the main monoterpene product {$\gamma$}-terpinene from geranyl diphosphate (GPP).

  abstract = {Background As the number of sequenced genomes rapidly increases, chromosome assembly is becoming an even more crucial step of any genome study. Since de novo chromosome assemblies are confounded by repeat-mediated artifacts, reference-assisted assemblies that use comparative inference have become widely used, prompting the development of several reference-assisted assembly programs for prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Findings We developed Chromosomer \textendash{} a reference-based genome arrangement tool, which rapidly builds chromosomes from genome contigs or scaffolds using their alignments to a reference genome of a closely related species. Chromosomer does not require mate-pair libraries and it offers a number of auxiliary tools that implement common operations accompanying the genome assembly process. Conclusions Despite implementing a straightforward alignment-based approach, Chromosomer is a useful tool for genomic analysis of species without chromosome maps. Putative chromosome assemblies by Chromosomer can be used in comparative genomic analysis, genomic variation assessment, potential linkage group inference and other kinds of analysis involving contig or scaffold mapping to a high-quality assembly.

The processes of species divergence, adaptive trait variation along ecological transitions, interactions with pollinators and dispersal agents, and ongoing hybridization are, however, barely treated in conservation policy and action. After a presentation of the traditional approach to conservation based on rare species protection and the identification and conservation management of protected areas, this chapter presents arguments for a complementary approach based on the processes of plant evolution. Its primary proposal is that preventing further loss of evolutionary potential should become a major target of contemporary conservation strategies for the Mediterranean flora.},

These hotspots of endemism also have a high diversity of total species. The recurrent conjunction of endemism and high species diversity in different parts of the region represents the cornerstone of Mediterranean plant biodiversity. The causes and origins of patterns of diversity and endemism, on both a biogeographic and local scale, are the main subjects of this chapter, which will first invoke the diverse origins of the flora, a premier cause of the patterns we now observe. A major theme this chapter will then develop is the examination of correlated patterns of diversity and endemism in relation to the historical biogeography of islands and mountains that are rich in endemic plants. As the chapter advances it will become more and more apparent that the history of mountain formation is a key element in the high rates of endemic plants both in continental areas and on islands. Finally, the ecological and biological correlates of endemism are treated, in particular the niche in which endemic plants have evolved and persisted.},

In order to improve Trichinella genome assemblies, the genome of the sylvatic encapsulated species Trichinella murrelli was sequenced using third-generation, long-read technology and, using syntenic comparisons, scaffolded to a reference genome assembly of Trichinella spiralis, markedly improving both. A high-quality draft assembly for T. murrelli was achieved that totalled 63{$\cdot$}2 Mbp, half of which was condensed into 26 contigs each longer than 571 000 bp. When compared with previous assemblies for parasites in the genus, ours required 10-fold fewer contigs, which were five times longer, on average. Better assembly across repetitive regions also enabled resolution of 8 Mbp of previously indeterminate sequence. Furthermore, syntenic comparisons identified widespread scaffold misassemblies in the T. spiralis reference genome. The two new assemblies, organized for the first time into three chromosomal scaffolds, will be valuable resources for future studies linking phenotypic traits within each species to their underlying genetic bases.},

The geological fragmentation of the Mediterranean into distinct microregions and tectonic movement of its different microplates has continually reshaped the configuration of the terrestrial landscapes, islands, and mountains. Many areas have been land bridge connections across the sea. The Mediterranean region has a characteristic climate, the essential element of which is the occurrence of a summer drought. Although initial trends towards aridity are ancient, the Mediterranean climate only dates to the Pliocene. Climatic oscillations since its onset have caused sea level changes, influencing the appearance and disappearance of land bridge connections across different parts of the Mediterranean Sea, causing species' range sizes to expand and contract in repeated phases. Finally, nowhere else in Europe has had such a long history of human presence and activity. In the last three millennia, the impact of human activities on the landscape has been dramatic in terms of the evolution of the mosaic landscape we now observe. The phased history of these three factors is at the heart of plant evolution in the Mediterranean.},

It also addresses the unique situation of the Mediterranean flora and its history, described in previous chapters. Whereas the other four MTE occur adjacent to an ocean, in a spatially limited climatic island, the Mediterranean flora has evolved around a sea, where marked historical phasing of geological and climatic change has caused the evolution of some quite unique patterns. All five MTE are biodiversity hotspots and, using illustrations from the other MTE, this chapter proposes that the similarity that we should now seek lies in an approach to conservation that integrates ecological and evolutionary processes.},

Annual plants do their best to avoid such constraints, and the role of functional traits in the regeneration niche and life-history strategy is undeniable. Perennial plants face the challenge of surviving their first summer and from then on illustrate a demographic persistence strategy. Dispersal and establishment generate interactions among species across a mosaic landscape where transitions between positive and negative interactions characterize successional dynamics. The study of two main features of the Mediterranean flora, its response to fire, and the diversity of aromatic plants illustrate well the importance of plant traits in the ecological dynamics of populations and communities in the mosaic landscape.},

Unfortunately, due to limited budgets typical for the area of conservation biology, genome assemblies of threatened species, when available, tend to be highly fragmented, represented by tens of thousands of scaffolds not assigned to chromosomal locations. The recent advent of high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) enables more contiguous assemblies containing scaffolds spanning the length of entire chromosomes for little additional cost. These inexpensive contiguous assemblies can be generated using Hi-C scaffolding of existing short-read draft assemblies, where N50 of the draft contigs is larger than 0.1\% of the estimated genome size and can greatly improve analyses and facilitate visualization of genome-wide features including distribution of genetic diversity in markers along chromosomes or chromosome-length scaffolds. We compared distribution of genetic diversity along chromosomes of eight mammalian species, including six listed as threatened by IUCN, where both draft genome assemblies and newer chromosome-level assemblies were available. The chromosome-level assemblies showed marked improvement in localization and visualization of genetic diversity, especially where the distribution of low heterozygosity across the genomes of threatened species was not uniform.},
